1.create a git repo and clone it in local
2.create code.py and add code to it.(it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3.do a git add -commit-push before initializing dvc.
4.now we will do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore ,.dvc) 
5.now do "mkdir s3" (Creates a new S3 directory) here we have created S3 directory in local system but in real word it should be on cloud
6.now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"  --> here by running this command we have told dvc to there remote path on S3 directory
and here in the code "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"  inplace of S3 we need to given S3 bucket cloud url if we use here AWS service.
7 next "dvc add data/" --> here we have asked to dvc that whaever seen in the data folder(like csv file txt file). dvc is responcible for there versioning
  > now it will ask to do:("git rm -r --cached 'data'") and ("git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
  > because initially we were tracking data/ folder  from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle
8. again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc" 
9. now "dvc commit" and then "dvc push" --> before run the"dvc commit" and "dvc push" S3 folder is empty and after run this "dvc push" and "dvc commit"
we can see two file in the S3 folder one file for unique token which is change when data is change and one file for updated data 
10. now make changes to code.py to append a new row in data , check changes vis "dvc status"
11. again "dvc commit" and "dvc push"
12. then git add-commit-push (we are saving V2 of our data at this point)
13, check dvc/git status ,everythings should be upto date
14 now repeat step 10-12 for v3 of data
